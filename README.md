# nohorny

Browser plugin to detect NSFW images, and when you try to click them, it bonks them with cheems, more characters (Jotaro) coming on the way!

It doesn't detect NSFW images _yet_, however, there's an existing plugin I can yoink code from. (With giving contribution to of course)


# Running locally

You can use web-ext to test the plugin in a browser sandbox.
For FireFox at least, I haven't tested other browsers.

`$ npm install -g web-ext`

`$ npm i`

`$ npx webpack`

`$ cd dist && web-ext run`
